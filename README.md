## About The Project:

The goal of our project is to analyze a series of documents created by the Department of Education called ”College Scorecards”. These consist of various categories concerning the institutions of the United States, including but not limited to: Graduating Debt, Graduating Income, Transfer status during schooling, and acceptance rate(among many others). Our hope is to analyze this data and discover trends concerning average debt of different institutions and other categories listed. We hope to find answers to various questions.

## Questions:

-   Do institutions with graduating debt tend to have higher graduating income?
    
    Our data has shown that schools with a high mean graduating debt have a low mean graduating income. 
    As well as schools with a low mean graduating debt have a high range of graduating income, meaning students with a low debt do not necessarily have a high income since that area of the data was all over.  
    
-   Do institutions with higher faculty salary tend to have higher levels of completion?
    
    Our data has shown schools that pay their factulty well have more students that complete college. When teachers are paid  atleast $7,000 a month you can start to see an increase in completion rates. By looking at both the data from the national averages and CU Boulders averages we can see that when teachers are paid more the students are more likely to graduate as well as make a higher earning. 

-   Do institutions with higher acceptance rates tend to have higher levels of debt on graduation?
    
    Our data shows there is no correlation between acceptance rates for schools and levels of debt on graduation. We did not find any correlation with the data to show institutions with higher acceptance rates have higher levels of debt on graduation.
   
-   Do institutions with higher graduation rates tend to have higher levels of debt on graduation?
    
    Our data shows institutions with higher graduation rates do tend to have higher levels of debt on graduation. There is a very slight trend in the data to show this, the slight trend could be since the data was very dificult to clean and certain information could not be taken out of the data giving not as much information as we would like. This dataset has lots of information, however, it was poorly organized and maintained giving skewed data.

## Application:

This project can be applied to various applications regarding college degree expenses. It can be seen as a good starting point for any person thinking about the debt that comes with the degree. For instance, the project can be expanded into a more accurate debt calculator for students to use. Moreover, the project also looked at the college degree as an investment. Thus, applications concerned with the benefits of degrees can use the project as well. For example, the ease of understanding the amount of debt and profit is very important to any person considering a college degree.
