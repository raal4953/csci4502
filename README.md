## About The Project:

The goal of our project is to analyze a series of documents created by the Department of Education called ”College Scorecards”. These consist of various categories concerning the institutions of the United States, including but not limited to: Graduating Debt, Graduating Income, Transfer status during schooling, and acceptance rate(among many others). Our hope is to analyze this data and discover trends concerning average debt of different institutions and other categories listed. We hope to find answers to various questions.

## Application:

This project can be applied to various applications regarding college degree expenses. It can be seen as a good starting point for any person thinking about the debt that comes with the degree. For instance, the project can be expanded into a more accurate debt calculator for students to use. Moreover, the project also looked at the college degree as an investment. Thus, applications concerned with the benefits of degrees can use the project as well. For example, the ease of understanding the amount of debt and profit is very important to any person considering a college degree.
